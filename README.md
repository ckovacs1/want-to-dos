WantToDo is an app for habits you want to form, or for the things that you’d like to do– that you have to squeeze in a little extra time for. Creating an account will allow you to keep all of the information you’ve gathered while using the app: notifications, followers, following, and WantToDos themselves. You can check out what tasks you want to do, like learning to paint or play the guitar, without also having to check deadlines or upcoming meetings– as you would on a traditional scheduler.



NOTE: It takes a while for render to start up so if you can't login instantly don't worry! Wait a 1-2 minutes and it will log you in :)
